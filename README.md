# Adritian Free Hugo Theme
###### Adritian Hugo Theme for Personal Websites

This free Hugo theme is a fork of [Raditian Theme](https://github.com/radity/raditian-free-hugo-theme) - a great Hugo theme created by Radity.
It's based on Bootstrap (so it's responsive and mobile-first), and the main changes have been upgrades on the web performance and accessibility of the template.

Some of the best usages for the theme are for minimalistic websites, single-page applications, and personal portfolios. It has a contact form that you can customize to your mail address, without setting up a backend (using https://formspree.io).


üöÄ Improvements on this version:

- removal of jQuery
- upgrade of Bootstrap from v4 to v5
- Hugo assets pipeline support
- some (basic) i18n features
- added more pages/templates
- upgrade loading performance (100 score in [Google Page Speed Insights](https://pagespeed.web.dev))
